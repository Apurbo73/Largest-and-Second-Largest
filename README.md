### Largest and Second Largest

This C++ program reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an array of integers and uses a set to automatically keep only distinct values (duplicates are removed). After collecting all unique elements, it converts them into a vector and sorts them in descending order, so the largest values come first.

Once sorted, the two largest distinct integers are at the beginning of the vector. The program simply adds these two numbers to get the maximum possible sum of two distinct elements and prints that result. This logic is repeated for each test case
